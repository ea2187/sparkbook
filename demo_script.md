## Production Notes:

### Voiceover Tips:
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace (~150 words/min)
- Pause briefly between sections for visual transitions
- Emphasize key features: "one place," "instantly," "one tap," "however you want"

### Visual Cues:
- Use smooth transitions between screens
- Highlight interactive elements (buttons, gestures) with subtle animations or highlights
- Show actual content (not just empty screens)
- Use consistent, clean UI throughout

### Captioning:
- Add captions for accessibility
- Highlight key phrases: "Sparklette," "community feed," "multimedia," "organize"
- Sync captions with voiceover timing

### Editing Tips:
- Cut on action (tap, swipe, etc.)
- Speed up repetitive actions (scrolling, multiple additions)
- Use zoom/pan on important UI elements
- Add subtle background music (optional, keep it minimal)
